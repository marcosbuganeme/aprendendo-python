Module Collections - Counter

Counter -> High-performance container datatypes

Counter is a subclass of dictionary class. It is used to keep the count of the elements in an iterable in the form of an unordered collection of elements. It is an unordered collection where elements are stored as dictionary keys and their counts are stored as dictionary values.

Collections in Python are containers that are used to store collections of data, for example, list, dict, set, tuple etc. These are built-in collections. Several modules have been developed that provide additional data structures to store collections of data. One such module is the Python Counter module.
