"""
Dictionary in python is an unordered collection of data in a key:value pair form.

Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.

Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

Keys are unique within a dictionary while values may not be. The values of a dictionary can be of any type, but the keys must be of an immutable data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.
